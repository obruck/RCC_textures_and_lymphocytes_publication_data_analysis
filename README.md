# Welcome to the data analysis repository of the "Integrative Analysis of Tissue Textures and Lymphocyte Infiltration in Renal Cell Carcinoma using Deep Learning" by Brummer Otso et al.


These codes will help you reproduce all plots and statistical analyses of the publication.  


## Instructions if you want to operate with RStudio
1. Install RStudio (the analyses here have been made with the version 3.5.1)
2. Install necessary R packages either by running the Rscript `src/install_packages.R`
3. Run the analyses at once by running the Rscript `src/main.R`. This will
- preprocess data files found in `./data/`
- produce tables and images in `./src/path/Images/``
